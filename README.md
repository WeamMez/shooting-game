# shooting-game
An automatic shooting game developed in C++ as an assignment for my B.Sc.
The yellow group is group 1, the red group is group 2.
The squares are the players and the light diamonds are the carriers, which carries medicine and weapons to the players in need in their group.

# Compilation
To compile the project in Linux:
1. Open the console and navigate to the project's directory
2. Type "g++ ./*.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut"
3. Press enter and run the output file.
4. Enjoy!

The "Game" Plays by itself, no need for pressing buttons :)
