# shooting-game
An automatic shooting game developed in C++ as an assignment for my B.Sc.

# Compilation
To compile the project in Linux:
1. Open the console and navigate to the project's directory
2. Type "g++ ./*.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut"
3. Press enter and run the output file.
4. Enjoy!

The "Game" Plays by itself, no need for pressing buttons :)
